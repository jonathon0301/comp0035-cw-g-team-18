## ***Very Important Message to Reader/Marker: Statement of Mixing GitHub Account***

A member in the team had used his another GitHub account on his IDE. :cry: 
This ultimately led to some of the changes were committed with that account. The GitHub account that he registered with the 
module leader on Moodle was jonathon0301, which is in the team and organization. The account that he logged on his IDE was 
JonathonShi. It can be inferred that these two accounts are the same person from username. This statement is used to waive any 
suspicions on academic misconduct. :pray: Thank you!
