#Software Engineering Tools and Techniques

##Github Source Code Control
In this group coursework, team members are allowed to access the group repository and coursework files using their own Github account. Later, team members create a branch to work in parallel on their own codespace or IDE (VScode or Xcode). A **Pull Request** is created when working in a **Branch** so team members receive feedback from other team members, and make further changes and **Commits** to the Branch, finally merging changes back to the **Master Branch**. With the Github source code control, team members are working more effectively and efficiently as we can make changes on files without affecting the main source code. After editing a file in our own codespace, we can quickly commit changes and push the update to the remote group repository. This also records our team members working process for the rest of us to understand the whole project process.

##Python Coding Environment
To cope with Section 3 Data Preparation, we applied Python to deal with our datasets. Before this, we cloned the repository in the Github account for making a Python project. With the new project created, we can apply the large selection of libraries that Python have to do basic data information, data visualization, an machine learning models, which give us more insight of our datasets. Since our main objective for the coursework is to design a web app, using Python allows us to build websites and test softwares with fewer coding steps. In this way, our team members, the web developers, can read and understand the code more easily, helping us find problems or errors easily so as to make improvements on the web design.
