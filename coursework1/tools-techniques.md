## *** Very Important Message to Reader/Marker: Statement of Mixing GitHub Account ***

At a very late stage of this coursework, a member in the team had realized he had used his another GitHub account on his IDE. :cry: 
This ultimately led to most of the changes were committed with that account. The GitHub account that he registered with the 
module leader on Moodle was jonathon0301, which is in the team and organization. The account that he logged on his IDE was 
JonathonShi. It can be inferred that these two accounts are the same person from user name. This statement is used to waive any 
suspisions on academic misconduct. :pray: Thank you!

## **Github Source Code Control**
 
In this group coursework, team members are allowed to access the group repository and coursework files using their 
own Github account. Later, team members work in parallel on their own machines with their selected 
IDE (VScode or PyCharm). Whenever there are some changes in one team member's work, we can commit and push to the 
remote repository on Github, so any further changes can be seen from Commits to the Branch. This is done by a Pull 
Request as changes are added to it, so team members receive feedback from other team members. Finally we merge all 
changes and different versions back to the Master Branch. With the Github source code control, team members are 
working more effectively and efficiently as we can make changes on files without affecting the main source code. 
After editing a file in our own IDE, we can quickly commit changes and push the update to the remote group 
repository. This also records our team members working process for the rest of us to understand the whole project process.

## **Python Coding Environment**
  
The project requires to use Python for data analytics and software development. Therefore, all of the team members have 
done things below:

1. Installed Python from python.org;
2. Installed git for using GitHub to work in team;
3. Signed up a GitHub account and joined in the group repository;
4. Downloaded IDE (VSCode or PyCharm) for working on own machine;
5. Created .venv virtual environment to separate the dependencies of different projects

## **Markdown for text**

Markdown is a commonly used format of documentation in software development. We have adopted a range of use in Markdown 
files including adding headings, styling, quoting codes, adding links, adding images, creating lists, creating tables, 
using emojis, and adding collapsed sections. ***The evidence for utilization can be proven from this and data.md file.***


## **pandas and matplotlib for data preparation**

The **pandas** and **matplotlib** are mandatory to use in this coursework for data preparation. The use of these packages 
can be shown in data_prep.py file.

## **Adopted CRISP_DM data science process model**

As planned in the project-method.pdf document, our team has adopted the CRISP_DM process model at this stage of the project 
as this stage only includes data analytics processes. We have followed the process model in series of Business Understanding, 
Data Understanding and Data Preparation. This process aligns with our deliverables of Business Needs, data_prep.py and data.md.

## **Progress Reporting**

All team members have reported their weekly progress on Moodle before PGTA sessions on Friday.
